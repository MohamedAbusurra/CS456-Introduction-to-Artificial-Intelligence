--- CS456 â€“ Assignment 1: Eight-Tile Puzzle (Uninformed Search)

This program solves the 8-tile puzzle using uninformed search algorithms as required in Assignment 1.

--- Implemented Algorithms
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)

--- Description
The program finds a sequence of moves from the start state to the goal state for eight tile puzzles using the selected search method.   
It displays:
- The sequence of board actions from start state to goal state
- The order of actions in sequence for found goal path (Up, Down, Left, Right)  
- Solution cost (number of moves to get from start state to goal state for the found solution path)  
- Number of nodes generated and expanded during the search methods execution
- Total search time for algorithm
